    <p>Selection Basis:</P>

    <ul>
      <li>Course Difficulty: JLOC is renowned for daunting trees, cement brick bases, and forbidden gardens</li>
      <li>Caliber: Second to None. Period.</li>
      <li>Passion: Winning is everything at the JLOC. League Tables > Bodily Health</li>
      <li>and Field Maintenance: long time fans of JLOC remember fan favorite Rocket. The ghost of Rocket can still be heard hollowing at the mailman, but no longer leaves hidden presents for the clean-up crew</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Guilty pleasure: Picking cherries while on first base</p>
    <p>Fallen Legends: B-Lo and M.C.H. have been MIA for years and have been permanently moved to IR</p>
